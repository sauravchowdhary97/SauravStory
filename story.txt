Once there was a student called James. He was studying Computer Science in the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even though, he was a senior he really was not sure if he wanted to study CS. Therefore, one day he decided to explore other majors but was not quite sure if he should do that, as that would only mean delayed graduation.
He went to seek help from his advisor. James told his advisor that he didn't like coding and debugging for his projects. The advisor told him that CS is not just about coding. He could join some CS clubs to explore more about CS.

So He joined the machine learning club and started to learn more about how neural networks perform, and eventually developed a strong liking for the theoretical side of computer science.

Unfortunately, his AI class involved fully coding a neural network, causing James to burn the midnight oil writing code day after day. However, when he was finished, James was surprised to find how interesting coding a real, useful program could be.

Being confident of his interests now, James was sure  that not only did he want a degree in Bachelors of Computer Science but also pursue a future career in the industry. He went on to be a successful Software Engineer at Google and lived happily ever after.
