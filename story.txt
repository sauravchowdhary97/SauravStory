Once there was a student called James. He was studying Computer Science in the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even though, he was a senior he really was not sure if he wanted to study CS. Therefore, one day he decided to explore other majors but was not quite sure if he should do that, as that would only mean delayed graduation.
